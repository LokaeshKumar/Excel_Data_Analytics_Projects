# 📚 Excel Data Analytics Projects

This repository contains two beginner-friendly Excel projects created as part of my learning journey into data analytics. Each project is organized into its own folder with the workbook and a detailed README explaining the analysis, skills used, and conclusions.

These projects helped me build a strong foundation in Excel for data cleaning, analysis, and creating simple dashboards.

## 1️⃣ Dashboard Project  
**Located in:** [Project_1-Salary_Dashboard](./Project_1-Salary_Dashboard)

This project focuses on analyzing job-related data using formulas and building a beginner-friendly Excel dashboard. It includes summary sheets for job platforms, job types, and countries, supported by charts and data validation elements.

Working on this project helped me practice essential Excel skills such as organizing data across multiple sheets, applying formulas, creating visual charts, and using validation lists to make the dashboard interactive and easy to explore.

## 2️⃣ Salary Analysis Project  
**Located in:** [Project_2-Job_Salary_Analysis](./Project_2-Job_Salary_Analysis)


This project explores how job roles, top skills, and salary levels are connected. I practiced beginner-level PowerPivot and data-modeling concepts, created combo charts, and used slicers connected across multiple sheets to filter the data interactively.

Formatting the sheets for clarity and exploring relationships between skills and salaries helped me understand how multi-sheet Excel models can be used to uncover insights and present data in an analytical way.
