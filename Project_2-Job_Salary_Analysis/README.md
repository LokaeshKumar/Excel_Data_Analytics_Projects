# 📊 Salary Analysis Excel Project

## Introduction  
This project is part of my Excel learning journey. I used a real-world style dataset of job listings to understand how different skills relate to salaries. While working on this project, I learned how to clean data, build summaries, and create simple visual insights. It gave me hands-on experience with Excel tools that are commonly used in data analysis.

## 🪜 What I Did (Step-by-Step)

1. **Loaded the dataset using Power Query**  
   - Imported the raw job listings and separated them into clean tables.  

2. **Cleaned and transformed the data**  
   - Removed unwanted text, standardized columns, and prepared a skills table.

3. **Created a Data Model**  
   - Linked the Jobs and Skills tables using `job_id`.  

4. **Built PivotTables**  
   - Summarized median salaries by job role, country, and skill.  

5. **Created DAX measures**  
   - Added a simple measure for calculating median salary where needed.  

6. **Made charts**  
   - Built visual charts to compare skill frequency and salary levels.  

7. **Explored insights**  
   - Observed how certain skills relate to higher salaries.

## 🔍 Key Findings  

- Jobs listing **more technical skills** usually show **higher median salaries**.  
- **Python and SQL** appeared in many higher-paying roles.  
- Cloud and data engineering skills were often linked to top salaries.  
- Basic office tools (like PowerPoint or Word) had lower salary associations.
